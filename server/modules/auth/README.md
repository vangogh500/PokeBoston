# Poke Boston (Auth Service)
Authorization service for PokeBoston

### Setting up local environment

To give the auth service instance access to online services used, you will need to create a `credentials.conf` in the conf folder located in the project directory. You will need to define the following:

* aws.cognito.region
* aws.cognito.poolId
* aws.cognito.clientId

You can locate aws credentials using the link and username/passwords you have obtained by me
